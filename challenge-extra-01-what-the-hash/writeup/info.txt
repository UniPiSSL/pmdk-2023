To complete the specific challenges you have to  follow a number of steps.

1. Combine the 3 strings.
2. Encode the produced string with the md5 hash function.
3. Add the hash to the flag format.

Example:

Let's pretend that we've cracked the three hashes and the following results produced:

1 - A
2 - B
3 - C

To sovle the challenge we have to: 

1. Combine the 3 strings: ABC
2. Encode the produced string with the md5 hash function: 902fbdd2b1df0c4f70b4a5d23525e932
3. Add the hash to the flag format: FLAG{902fbdd2b1df0c4f70b4a5d23525e932}
